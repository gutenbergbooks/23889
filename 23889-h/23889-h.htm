way up, but Professor
Lightning didn't seem
to care. Outside the
cooktent Wrout flapped
his arms and, on that signal, Seaman
started up the big electric band,
whooping it up with John Philip
Sousa for openers, while all over the
midway the lights snapped on, big
whites and yellows, reds, greens,
purples and dusky violets framing,
in a titillating dimness, the front flap
of the girlie tent. The outside talkers
were busy outside the spectacle tents
like Wicks' Hell Drivers, Biggest
Auto Show in Fifty States&mdash;outside
the grind shows, the eats, the rides:
"Here and now, for the fourth part
of one single dollar bill, the most
amazing ..." "... Terrifying and
strange beings from the farthest
reaches of the Earth who will exhibit
..." "... Dances learned at the
Court of the Sultan, Ay-rab dances
right here, right on the inside, for
only&mdash;"</p>

<p>And the crowd, filing in, laughed
and chattered and shrieked on swooping
rides, the Great Crane, the Space
Race, the Merry-Go-Round and the
Horses, threw down money to win
a kewpie doll, a Hawaiian lei, a real
life-size imitation scale model of
Luna in three real dimensions ...
living it up on the first show, while
the rocket climbed on and out, and
bubbled excitement in the blood.</p>

<p>The rocket was up: the carnival
was open. But Professor Lightning
didn't seem to care. He sat in the
cooktent with his eyes hooded and
hidden under the unshaded glow
of a hundred-and-fifty-watt Forever
bulb, while Charley de Milo fidgeted
his feet, and listened, and tried to cut
the old man off.</p>

<p>"Look, professor," he said nervously,
"why don't we talk about it later?
Table it, till after the show?" He
scratched the side of his head with
his left foot. "I got to go on in a
couple of minutes," he said. "I can
hear the talker going now. I got
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forget the show," Professor
Lightning said. His voice was flatter
and harsher, and his face more tense,
than Charley ever remembered seeing
it. "The show isn't important."</p>

<p>Charley blinked, trying to understand.
"But, Professor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen to me," Professor Lightning
said. "The world is at the beginning
of a new cultural revolution.
Since the Cold War melted, and freedom
of inquiry and research began
to live again on both sides of the
old Iron Curtain, science has begun
a new Renaissance. The cultural interflow
has&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please, professor," Charley said
miserably, rubbing his toes together.
"There isn't much time before I got
to go on. And you ought to be inside
the Science tent, too, because any
minute&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I am not in the tent," Professor
Lightning said calmly, "I will not
appear in the show. It does not
matter."</p>

<p>"But they'll fire you," Charley said.
He grabbed for a cigarette with his
right foot and got it into his mouth.
Striking a match with his left foot,
he lit the cigarette and blew out a
long, ragged plume of smoke. "If
you're not there on time," he said in
strained tones, "they'll fire you. And
what about me?"</p>

<p>Professor Lightning gestured with
both big hands. It was the same
movement he used every night, when
he showed the crowd there were no
wires or batteries secreted on his
person. Charley half-expected him to
grab hold of a couple of light bulbs
and show them glowing in his fists.
But the gesture was meant, this time,
as an aid to relaxation. "Don't
worry," Professor Lightning said, in
a grating sort of caricature of a soothing
tone. "If they fire me ... well,
then, they save me the trouble of
quitting. And as for you, my boy,
a carnival job should be the furthest
thing from your thoughts."</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't," Charley said sourly.
"And if you'll excuse me, professor,
I care how I get the money to
eat, even if you don't. I got a good
job&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't need your job," Professor
Lightning said, "if you'll listen
to me."</p>

<p>Charley made up his mind. Much
as he hated to be impolite, there
were some things more important
than social forms, he decided. He
stood up. "After the show, professor,"
he said with firmness, and went
out of the cooktent, heading at a
rapid dogtrot for the big tent at the
other side of the midway. As he
reached it he could see Dave Lungs,
the outside talker, climb up on the
front platform to begin his spiel.</p>

<p>"Marvels of the world!" Dave announced
without preliminary. "Wonders
of the natural universe! Surprises
and startling sights for every member
of the family!" By the time he had
got that far, a crowd was beginning
to collect in front of the platform.
"For the fourth part of a single dollar
bill&mdash;" Dave went on, but Charley
didn't have the time to listen; he
was in the bally.</p>

<p>He lifted the backflap of the tent
with one foot, and wriggled inside.</p>

<p>As he made his way to the cluster
of people near the front flap, past
the booths and stands, he felt an
enormous sense of relief. He had
made it&mdash;with all of fifty seconds to
spare.</p>

<p>Ned and Ed stood next to him.
"Where you been?" Ed said in a
nasal whisper.</p>

<p>"I got held up," Charley explained.
"Professor Lightning, he was talking
to me, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Later," Ned said. His voice was
lower and throatier than Ed's; it was
the only way Charley could tell them
apart, but then, he thought, nobody
ever had to tell them apart. They
were, like all Siamese twins, always
together. "We're going on," Ned
said, and he and his twin moved forward.</p>

<p>Charley moved into place behind
them, and came out blinking in the
glare of the front platform.</p>

<p>"Siamese twins," Dave was shouting.
"A contemporary marvel of
science, ladies and gentlemen&mdash;and
here we have ..."</p>

<p>Charley stepped forward as Ned
and Ed stepped back into the shadows
again.</p>

<p>"... Charley de Milo! Ladies and
gentlemen, the world-wide fame of
this brave and talented boy is stupendous!
His feats of skill will amaze
you! Watch him thread a needle!
Watch him comb his hair! And all
for one thin quarter, ladies and gentlemen,
only the fourth part&mdash;"</p>

<p>The electronic band choked on
Sousa, coughed and began again with
Kabalevsky. Charley watched the
audience below, staring up at him,
hundreds of faces. He heard their
gasp as he flexed his shoulders and
turned. He grinned down, taking a
second longer than usual, and then
stepped back, still grinning.</p>

<p>"Charley de Milo, the Armless
Wonder!" Dave said. "And many
more sights inside, ladies and gentlemen,
sights to amaze you, sights to
chill your very blood, sights ..."</p>

<hr />

<p>One-thirty, and the last show over.
The rocket had come down for the
night; all over the midway lights
were blinking off and silence was
creeping, like a stain, over the
ground. Professor Lightning was sitting
on his bunk, in the small tent
he shared with Erma the Fish Girl.
Erma was out drinking with Dave
Lungs and some of the others, and
only the professor and Charley de
Milo were in the room. Charley was
sitting on Erma's bunk, looking resigned.</p>

<p>"Well, if you still want to talk to
me," he said, "now's your chance.
O.K.?"</p>

<p>"I certainly want to talk to you,"
Professor Lightning said firmly. "I
want to tell you of the most important
moment of your life."</p>

<p>Charley tried to think of something
to say to this, but there wasn't anything.
He shifted on the bunk,
scratched at his nose with his left
foot, and grinned spastically. "Sure,"
he said at random. "And, by the way,
I'm sorry about before, professor. But
the show was going on, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The show," Professor Lightning
said, in tones of the utmost contempt.
"Forget about the show&mdash;now, and
tomorrow, and forever."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No words," Professor Lightning
said, raising a hand delicately.
"Please. Allow me to tell you of my
invention."</p>

<p>Charley sighed and lay back on the
bed. "Invention, professor?" he said.
"You mean sort of a machine?"</p>

<p>For some reason, Professor Lightning
looked irritated. "It's not a
machine," he said flatly. Then he
sighed and his tone changed. "Charley,
my boy," he said, "do you
remember what I was telling you
before? About how the world has entered
a new Age of Science? How
new inventions, new discoveries, are
coming along every day?"</p>

<p>"Well, sure," Charley said. "The
papers talk about it every once in
a while. You know, I see the papers,
or the Chicago <i>American</i>, anyhow.
My mother sends it to me. She likes
the columns."</p>

<p>"Why," Professor Lightning went
on, as if he hadn't been listening at
all, "right here in Wrout's Carnival
Shows, we have things that just
didn't exist ten or fifteen years ago.
The electronic band. The Forever
bulb."</p>

<p>"That's right," Charley put in.
"And look at Joe Wicks. Why, he
can do tricks with all those new
things they got on cars, tricks nobody
ever did before or even thought about
in the old days."</p>

<p>"And more fundamental discoveries,"
the professor said. "Chadwick's
Law of Dimensionality, Dvedkin and
the Ontological Mean ... oh, I
keep up with the literature. No matter
what's happened to me, I keep up
with the literature."</p>

<p>Charley sighed, very softly so as
not to injure the professor's feelings.
But he did hope the old man wasn't
going to start on all those stories
about his lost career again. Charley
knew&mdash;everybody in the Wrout show
did&mdash;that Professor Lightning had
been a real professor once, at some
college or other. Biology, or Biological
Physics, or something else&mdash;he'd
taught classes about it, and done
research. And then there had been
something about a girl, a student the
professor had got himself involved
with. Though it was pretty hard to
imagine the professor, white-haired
and thin the way he was now, chasing
after a girl.</p>

<p>He'd been fired, or something, and
he'd drifted for a while and then
got himself an act and come with a
Carnival. Charley knew the whole
story. He didn't want to hear it again.</p>

<p>But the professor said: "I'm as
good as I ever was&mdash;better than I
ever was, my boy. I've been keeping
up, doing experiments. I've been
quiet about it."</p>

<p>Everybody, Charley thought, knew
about Professor Lightning and his
experiments. If they kept the old man
happy, kept him contented and doing
shows, why not? After all, the old
guy didn't drink or anything really
serious; if he wanted to play around
with test tubes and even Bunsen
burners, people figured, why, let him.</p>

<p>But Professor Lightning thought
nobody knew. Well, he had been
a real professor once, which is to say
a square. Some people never really
adjusted to carny life&mdash;where everybody
knows everything.</p>

<p>Charley figured maybe it was better
to act surprised. "Really?" he said.
"Experiments?"</p>

<p>Professor Lightning looked
pleased, which satisfied Charley.
"I've been on the track of something
big," he said. He seemed to be talking
more to himself than to Charley.
"Something new," he said. "And at
last ... at last, my boy, I've found
it. I'll be famous, Charley, famous&mdash;and
so will you!"</p>

<p>"That's nice," Charley said politely.
Then he blinked. "But what do
you mean," he added, "me?"</p>

<p>"I want you to help me," the
professor said. He leaned forward,
and in the dim light of the tent's
single lamp, his eyes glittered. "I
want you to come with me."</p>

<p>"Come with you?" Charley said,
and swallowed hard. He'd never
thought, the way some did, that the
old man was crazy. But it did look
as if he'd slipped a couple of cogs
for sure and for real. "Where?"
Charley said.</p>

<p>"Washington," the professor said
instantly. "New York. London, Paris.
Rome. The world, Charley. The
world that's going to do us homage."</p>

<p>Charley shifted a little in the bed.
"Look, professor," he said, "I've got
a job, right here in the carny. I
couldn't leave here. So suppose we
just&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your job?" the professor said.
"Your job's gone, my boy. Wait.
Let me tell you what I've discovered.
Let me tell you what has happened&mdash;happened
to you, my boy. To you,
and to me."</p>

<p>Charley sat upright, slowly.
"Well," he said, "all right, professor."</p>

<p>Professor Lightning beamed, and
his eyes glittered brighter and brighter.
"Limb regeneration," he said, and
his voice was as soft and quiet as if
he'd been talking about the most
beautiful woman in the world. "Limb
regeneration."</p>

<hr />

<p>Charley waited a long minute before
he admitted to himself that he
didn't have the faintest idea what the
professor was talking about.
"What?" he said at last.</p>

<p>Professor Lightning shook his head
slightly. "Charley," he said softly,
"you're an Armless Wonder. That's
right, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Sure it is, professor," Charley
said. "You know that. I was born
that way. Made a pretty good thing
out of it, too."</p>

<p>"Well," Professor Lightning said,
"you don't have to be one. Can you
realize that?"</p>

<p>Charley nodded slowly. "Sure I
don't," he said. "Only it's pretty
good money, you know? And there's
no sense in sitting around back home
and feeling sorry for myself, is
there? I mean, this way I can make
money and have a job and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," Professor Lightning said
emphatically.</p>

<p>Charley blinked. "No?" he said.</p>

<p>Professor Lightning shook his
head, meaningfully. "Charley, my
boy," he said, "I don't mean that
you should go home and mope. But
think about this: suppose you had
your arms? Suppose you had two
arms, just like everybody else."</p>

<p>"Why think about anything like
that?" Charley said. "I mean, I am
what I am. That's the way things
are. Right?"</p>

<p>"Wrong," Professor Lightning
said. "I can give you arms, Charley.
I can make you normal. Just like
everybody else."</p>

<p>"Well," Charley said. After a few
seconds he said: "Gee." Then he
said: "You're kidding me, professor."</p>

<p>"I'm perfectly serious," Professor
Lightning said.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me show you," Professor
Lightning said. He stood up and went
to the flap of the tent. "Come with
me," he said, and Charley got up,
dumbly, and followed him out into
the cool darkness outside.</p>

<p>Later, Charley couldn't remember
all that Professor Lightning had
showed him or told him. There were
some strange-looking animals called
salamanders; Professor Lightning had
cut their tails off and they'd grown
new tails. That, he said, happened
in nature. But he had gone a step
farther. He had isolated the particular
factor that made such regrowth possible.</p>

<p>Charley remembered something
about a molecular lattice, but it didn't
make any sense to him, and was only
a puzzle. But the professor told him
all about the technique, in a very
earnest and scientific voice that was
convincing to listen to, and showed
him mice that he'd cut the tails off
of, and the mice had brand-new tails,
and even feet in one or two cases.
There were a whole lot of small
animals in cages, all together in back
of the professor's tent, and Charley
looked at all of them. The professor
had a flashlight, and everything was
very clear and bright.</p>

<p>When the demonstration was over,
Charley had no doubts at all. It was
obvious to him that the professor
could do just what he said he could
do: grow limbs on things. Charley
scratched his head with his left foot,
nervously.</p>

<p>"That's why I came to you," the
professor said. "I need a human
being&mdash;just to show the scientific
world that my technique works on
human beings. And I've worked with
you for a number of years now,
Charley."</p>

<p>"Five," Charley said. "Five since
you came with Wrout."</p>

<p>"I like you," the professor said. "I
want to make you the first, the very
first, person to be helped by my
technique."</p>

<p>Charley shifted his feet. "You
mean you want to give me arms," he
said.</p>

<p>"That's right," the professor said.</p>

<p>"No," Charley said.</p>

<hr />

<p>Professor Lightning nodded.
"Now, then," he said. "We'll get
right to work on ... Charley, my
boy, what did you say?"</p>

<p>Charley licked his lips. "I said
no," he said.</p>

<p>Professor Lightning waited a long
minute. "You mean you don't believe
me," he said at last. "You think I'm
some sort of a crackpot."</p>

<p>"Not at all," Charley said politely.
"I guess if you say you can do this
... well, I see all the animals, and
everything, and I guess you can do
it. That's O.K."</p>

<p>"But you're doubtful," Professor
Lightning said.</p>

<p>Charley shook his head. "No,"
he said. "You can do it, all right. I
guess I'm sure of that, professor."</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/003.png" width="182" height="550" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Then," the professor said, in a
tenser voice, "you think it might be
dangerous. You think you might be
hurt, or that things might not work
out right, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gee," Charley said, "I never
thought of anything like that, professor.
I know you wouldn't want to
hurt me."</p>

<p>"I certainly wouldn't," Professor
Lightning said. "I want to help you.
I want to make you normal. Like
everybody else."</p>

<p>"Sure," Charley said uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Then you'll do it," Professor
Lightning said. "I knew you would,
Charley. It's a great opportunity.
And I offered it to you because
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gee, I know," Charley said, feeling
more uncomfortable than ever.
"And don't think I don't appreciate
it. But look at it my way, professor."
He paused. "Suppose I had two arms&mdash;just
like everybody else, the way
you tell me. What would happen to
me?"</p>

<p>"Happen?" Professor Lightning
blinked. "Why, Charley ... why,
you could do anything you liked.
Anything. You'd have the same opportunities
as anybody else. You
could be ... well, my boy, you could
be anything."</p>

<p>"Could I?" Charley said. "Excuse
me for talking about this, professor,
but I've had a lot of time to think
about it. And it's all sort of new to
you. I mean, you weren't born the
way I was, and so you just don't
understand it."</p>

<p>Professor Lightning said: "But, my
boy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No." Charley said. "Let me explain
this. Because it's important."
He cleared his throat, sat down on
the ground and fumbled for a cigarette.
He found one in his shirt
pocket, carried it to his lips with
his right foot, and lit a match with
his left. When he was smoking easily,
he went on.</p>

<p>"Professor, do you know how old
I am?" he said. "I'm forty-two years
old. Maybe I don't look it, but that's
how old I am. Now, I've spent all
my life learning to do one thing,
and I do a pretty good job of it.
Anyhow, good enough to get me a
spot with Wrout's show, and probably
with anybody else I wanted to
work for."</p>

<p>"But your arms&mdash;?" the professor
said.</p>

<p>"That's what I mean," Charley
said. "I don't have any arms. I never
had any. Maybe I miss 'em, a little&mdash;but
everything I do is based on the
fact that I don't have 'em. Now,
professor, do you know what I am?"</p>

<p>Professor Lightning frowned.
"What you are?" he said.</p>

<p>"I'm an Armless Wonder," Charley
said. "That's a pretty good thing
to be. In a carny, they look up to
an Armless Wonder&mdash;he's a freak,
a born freak, and that's as high as
you can go, in a carny. I get a good
salary&mdash;I send enough to my mother
and my sister, in Chicago, for them
to live on. And I have what I need
myself. I've got a job, professor, and
standing, and respect." He paused.
"Now, suppose I had arms. I'd have
to start from scratch, all over again.
I'd have to start from the bottom up,
just learning the basic elements of
any job I signed on for. I'd be a forty-two-year-old
man doing the work
of an eighteen-year-old. And not
making much money. And not having
much standing, or respect."</p>

<p>Charley took the cigarette out of
his mouth with his right foot, held
it for a second and put it back.</p>

<p>"I'd be normal," he said. "I'd be
just like everybody else, professor.
And what do I want anything like
<i>that</i> for?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Professor Lightning tried everything,
but it wasn't any good.
"Fame," he said, and Charley pointed
out, calmly and reasonably, that
the kind of fame he'd get from being
an experimental subject was just like
being a freak, all over again&mdash;except
that it would wear off, and then, he
asked, where would he be? Professor
Lightning talked about Man's Duty
to Science, and Charley countered
with Science's Duty to Man. Professor
Lightning tried friendship, and argument,
and even force&mdash;but nothing
worked. Incredible as it seemed to the
professor, Charley was content to remain
a freak, an Armless Wonder.
More, he seemed to be proud and
happy about it.</p>

<p>It was too bad that the professor
didn't think of the one argument that
might have worked. In the long run,
it wouldn't have made any difference,
perhaps&mdash;but it would have
cleared matters up, right there and
then. Because the one workable argument
had a good chance of succeeding.</p>

<p>But, then, Professor Lightning
really didn't understand carny. He
never thought of the one good argument,
and after a while he gave up,
and went away.</p>

<p>Of course, that was several days
later. Professor Lightning told Charley
that he was leaving for New
York, and Charley said: "What? In
the middle of the season?" Then he
told Wrout, and Wrout screamed and
ranted and swore that Professor
Lightning would never work in carny
again. "I'll have you blacklisted!" he
roared.</p>

<p>And Professor Lightning shrugged
and smiled and went away to pack.
He took all his notebooks, and all the
cages with little animals in them, and
he didn't seem at all disturbed. "I'll
find another subject," he told
Charley, when he left. "When they
find out what I've got, in New
York, they'll provide me with subjects
by the hundred. I did want to help
you ..."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Charley said honestly.</p>

<p>"... But that's the way things
are, I suppose," Professor Lightning
said. "Maybe some day you'll
realize."</p>

<p>Charley shook his head. "I'm
afraid not, professor," he said, and
Professor Lightning shook Charley's
foot, and left, and Charley went back
to work in the freak show, and for
a while he didn't even think about
Professor Lightning. Then, of course,
the news began to show up in the
Chicago <i>American</i>, which Charley got
two or three days late because his
mother sent it to him by mail.</p>

<p>At first Charley didn't realize that
Dr. Edmund Charles Schinsake was
Professor Lightning, but then the
<i>American</i> ran his picture; that was
the day Professor Lightning was
awarded a medal by the AMA, and
Charley felt pleased and happy for
the old man. It looked as it he'd
got what he wanted.</p>

<p>Charley, of course, didn't think
much about the professor's "limb regeneration";
he didn't need it, he
thought, and he didn't want it, and
that was that.</p>

<p>And then, one night, he was dropped
from the bally, and he asked
Dave Lungs about it, and Dave said:
"Well, we want the biggest draw we
can get, out there before the show,"
and put Erma, the Fish Girl, out in
his place. And Charley started to
wonder about that, and after a few
days had gone by he found himself
talking about it, to Ed Baylis, over in
the cooktent while they were having
lunch.</p>

<p>Baylis was a little man of sixty or
so, with a wrinkled face like a walnut
and a powerful set of lungs; he
was Wrout's outside talker for the
girlie show. "Because I'm old," he
said, grinning. "I don't have trouble
with the girls. And if I got to take
one off the bally or out of the show
there's no personal stuff that would
make it tough, see what I mean?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm worried about,"
Charley said.</p>

<p>"What?" Ed asked. He speared a
group of string beans with his fork
and conveyed them to his mouth.
Charley, using his right foot, did the
same.</p>

<p>"The bally," Charley said. "The
way things are, Dave took me off,
and I'm worrying about it."</p>

<p>"Maybe some kind of a change,"
Ed said.</p>

<p>Charley shook his head. "He said
... he said he wanted the biggest
draw out there. Now, you know I'm
a big draw, Ed. I always have been."</p>

<p>"Sure," Ed said. He chewed another
mouthful and swallowed. "Still,
people want a change now and then.
Doesn't have to mean anything."</p>

<p>"Maybe not," Charley said uncomfortably.
But he wasn't convinced.</p>

<hr />

<p>The season drew to a close, and
Charley went off to the Florida Keys,
where he spent a month living with
some friends before holing up with
his mother and sister for the winter.
He was offered a job in New York,
at a year-round flea museum in Times
Square, but after some thought he
decided against it. He'd never had to
work winters, and he wasn't going to
start.</p>

<p>After all, he was still doing well,
wasn't he? He told himself emphatically
that he was. He was an Armless
Wonder, a born freak, the top of the
carny ladder, with a good job wherever
he cared to look for one.</p>

<p>He had to tell himself that quite a
few times before he began to believe
it.</p>

<p>Spring came, and then summer,
and Charley kissed his mother and his
sister good-by and joined Wrout's
Carnival Shows in Summit, Idaho,
three days before their opening. He
didn't notice much change from previous
years, but it took an effort not
to notice some things.</p>

<p>Not like the new man who'd taken
Professor Lightning's place&mdash;a tall
thin youngster who had an Electric
Chair act. Or like the periodic quarrels
between Ned and Ed; it seemed
they'd met a girl over the winter season,
and disagreed about her. Ed
thought she was perfectly wonderful;
Ned couldn't see her for beans.</p>

<p>No, things like that were a part of
carny; you got used to them, as the
show rolled along year after year, and
paid no more attention to them than
a housewife pays to rather uninteresting
back-fence gossip.</p>

<p>It was something else that had
changed, something important.</p>

<p>His contract, for instance. It was
made out for the same pay as he'd
been getting, but the option periods
were shortened up; suddenly, Charley
was living from season to season,
with almost no assurance of continuous,
steady work. Old man Wrout
had looked a little less than happy
when he'd given Charley the contract;
he'd almost seemed ashamed,
and he hadn't really looked Charley
in the eye once. But when Charley
asked what was wrong, he got no
answer.</p>

<p>Or none that meant anything. "It's
just the way things are," Wrout muttered.
"Don't make no difference,
kid."</p>

<p>But it did make a difference. Charley
wasn't out in the bally any more,
either; he was backstage among the
second-rate acts, the tattooed man and
the fire-eater and the rest, while Erma
and Ned and Ed and the top-liners
took their bows out before the crowd,
pulling them in, and got the gasps
and the applause.</p>

<p>The crowds in front of his own
platform, inside during the show,
were smaller, too. At first Charley
thought that was due to the bally itself,
but as the season began and wore
on, the crowds continued to shrink
beyond all expectation. Counting as
he worked, combing his hair with
one foot, drawing little sketches for
the customers ("Take one home for
only one extra dime, a treasured souvenir
especially personalized for you
by Charley de Milo")&mdash;counting the
house, he discovered one evening that
he was the smallest draw in the tent.
The tattooed man did better than
Charley de Milo, which was enough
of a disgrace; the rest were so far
ahead that Charley didn't even want
to think about it.</p>

<p>His first idea was that somebody
was out to get him. He could feel the
muscles of his shoulders and back
bunching up when he tried thinking
what to do about the sabotage that
had struck him; but an Armless Wonder
has one very real disadvantage.
He can comb his own hair and brush
his own teeth; he can feed himself
and&mdash;with proper clothing&mdash;dress
himself; he can open doors and shut
windows and turn the pages of books.
But he can't engage in a free-for-all
fight, not without long and careful
training in that style of battle known
as <i>savate</i>, or boxing with the feet.
Charley had never learned <i>savate</i>; he
had never needed it.</p>

<p>For the first time since he could
remember, he felt helpless. He wasn't
normal; he couldn't do what any normal
man could do. He wanted to find
the man who was sabotaging his
show, and beat him into a confession,
and throw him off the lot&mdash;</p>

<p>And he couldn't.</p>

<p>The muscles of his back pulled and
pulled at him. He clenched his jaw.
Then Dave Lungs came over to his
platform and he forced himself to
relax, sweating. There were four or
five people behind Dave, ordinary
marks with soft, soft faces and round
eyes. While Dave talked Charley
went through his act; perhaps ten
other marks were scattered in the
tent, standing at other platforms,
watching other acts even without
Dave there to guide them and talk
them up.</p>

<p>And when he was through Dave
sold exactly one of the sketches Charley
had done. One. An old man
bought it, a chubby little Santa Claus
of a man with eyes that twinkled and
a belly that undoubtedly shook like a
jelly bowl when it was freed from its
expensive orlon confines. Dave went
off to the next platform, where Erma
stood, and the marks followed him,
and more drifted over. Erma had ten
customers, Charley noticed, and he
grabbed a handkerchief from the
platform floor and wiped his damp
face with one foot.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Something's wrong</i>, he thought
stupidly, and he must have said it
aloud because, at his feet, a high,
thin old voice said: "What was that,
son? Did you say something?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," Charley mumbled,
and looked down. The Santa
Claus man was staring up at him.
"Show's over," Charley said, more
curtly than he meant. He took a deep
breath and set his feet more firmly on
the platform, but it didn't do any
good. He was like a coiled spring,
waiting for release.</p>

<p>"I don't expect any show," Santa
Claus said. "Really I don't. But I did
want to talk to you for a few minutes,
if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"I'm not in a talking mood," Charley
said. "Sorry." He was ashamed of
the words as soon as he brought them
out; that was no way to treat any
stranger, not even a mark. But it was
a long second before he could say
anything else. Santa Claus stood
watching him patiently, holding
Charley's sketch by one corner in his
left hand.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Charley said at last.
"It ... must be the heat. I'm kind
of on edge."</p>

<p>"Of course," Santa Claus said. "I
understand. Really I do."</p>

<p>There was a little silence. Dave
and the crowd trailed away from
Erma and headed for Senor Alcala,
the fire-eater at the end of the row.
Charley barely heard Dave's spiel; he
licked his lips and said: "You wanted
to talk to me."</p>

<p>"Now," Santa Claus said, "I don't
want you to be ashamed of anything.
There's nothing personal in this,
really there isn't. But I do want to
help if I can, help anyone who needs
help."</p>

<p>"I don't need help," Charley said.
"I'm sorry." He tried to keep his
voice gentle. The old man obviously
meant well; there was no sense in
hurting him.</p>

<p>"It's your ... infirmity," Santa
Claus said. "Boy, have they been
keeping the news from you?"</p>

<p>"News?" Charley said, with a sudden
sick feeling.</p>

<p>"In New York," Santa Claus said.
"There's a doctor there&mdash;a man who
can help people like you. He has a
new technique. I was reading in the
papers just the other day&mdash;there was
a man injured in a railroad accident,
who lost one arm and one leg. This
doctor used him as his first subject."</p>

<p>"He said he'd find another one,"
Charley put in without thinking.</p>

<p>"Another?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," Charley said.
"You were going to suggest that I go
and see this doctor. Is that right?"</p>

<p>"Well," Santa Claus said, seeming
oddly embarrassed, "it can't hurt, you
know. And it might help. Really it
might. And then ... then you might
not have to ... have to be the way
you are, and do what you do."</p>

<p>Charley took a long breath. "I'll
think about it," he said, in the very
politest tone he could manage.</p>

<p>"I only want to help," Santa Claus
said.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you do," Charley said.
"And thanks."</p>

<p>"If there's anything I can do&mdash;"</p>

<p>Charley smiled down. "That's all
right," he said. "Thanks. But I guess
you'd better join the rest&mdash;if you
want to see the show at all."</p>

<p>Santa Claus said: "Oh. Of course."
He turned and found the group just
leaving Senor Alcala's platform, and
scurried off to catch up with them.
Charley stared at his retreating back,
fighting to stay calm.</p>

<p>That was the way marks were, of
course, and there wasn't anything to
be done about it. It was always "the
way you <i>have</i> to be," and "the things
you <i>have</i> to do." It never seemed to
enter their heads that pity was unnecessary
baggage where a born freak
was concerned, any more than it had
entered Professor Lightning's head.
A born freak, Charley reflected, had
a pretty good life of it, all told; why,
even marriage wasn't out of the question.
Charley knew of some very
happy ones.</p>

<p>But the marks pitied you, Charley
thought. And maybe it wasn't especially
smart to tell them anything different;
pity, as much as anything else,
keep them coming. Pity, and a kind
of vicarious victory. When Charley
threaded a needle, he was telling all
the marks: "It doesn't matter what
kind of accident happens to you&mdash;you
can overcome it. You can go on and
do anything. It's all what you make it&mdash;everything,
every bad turn life
hands you can be made into something
better. If I can do it, you can
do it."</p>

<p>That was what the marks felt,
Charley thought. It was wrong-headed,
it was stupid, and it could be a
simple nuisance&mdash;but it brought in
the dough. Why argue with it? Why
try to change it?</p>

<p>Charley nearly grinned. The crowd
of marks moved on down the other
side of the tent, and Charley watched
them. Ned and Ed drew the biggest
crowd, an attentive, almost rapt crew
who could be suckered into buying
anything the Siamese twins wanted to
sell them. Dave milked them for all
they were worth, and Charley nodded
quietly to himself. Dave was a good
carny man.</p>

<p>He worked for the good of the
show. Or&mdash;did he?</p>

<p>Dave had taken him off the bally.
Did Dave have some reason to hate
him? Could Dave be out to get him?</p>

<p>Charley couldn't think why, but it
was a lead, the only one he had. And
if Dave did turn out to be behind
everything that was happening, Charley
knew exactly what he was going
to do.</p>

<p>He couldn't beat Dave himself.</p>

<p>But he had friends&mdash;</p>

<hr />

<p>After the show, that night, Charley
went hunting for Ed Baylis. Ed had
been around Wrout's a long time,
and if anything were going on Ed
would know about it. Charley went
down to the girlie tent, and found
Ed just clearing up. All over the midway,
the lights were going out, and
the Mars Race game gave one final
roar and came to a halt. The last customers
were leaving.</p>

<p>Ed looked up when he came over.
Charley didn't ease into the subject;
he couldn't. "Something's wrong,"
he said at once. "I'm off the bally,
and the crowds are going down. I
don't like it, Ed."</p>

<p>Baylis shrugged. "Who would?"
he said.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;something's wrong," Charley
said. "Ed, you know what's happening.
You get the word. Let me in
on it."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about
this," Ed said at once. But his face
was still, his eyes shuttered in the
darkness.</p>

<p>Charley kept after him. They went
behind the girlie tent, talking softly.
Overhead a rocket burned by, but
neither man looked up.</p>

<p>At last Ed sighed. "Just forget
about it," he said. "Just do your job.
That's all that matters. You don't
want to know anything else."</p>

<p>"Why don't I?" Charley said.
"Sure I do. And it's no good telling
me to do my job. The way things are
running, Ed, I'm not going to <i>have</i>
a job very long."</p>

<p>"There's nothing you can do about
it," Ed said. "Believe me. You don't
want to know because knowing
wouldn't do you any good. And you
wouldn't believe me if I told you."</p>

<p>"Try me," Charley said. "Go
ahead." He scratched at one shin
with the other foot.</p>

<p>"Well," Ed began, and then stopped.
He shook his head. "Look,
Charley, let me tell this my way.
Something like this happened before.
A long while back&mdash;before the Cold
War started, let alone ended."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," Charley said. A drop
of sweat ran slowly down his forehead.
He tried to ignore it.</p>

<p>"Did I ever tell you I used to talk
for a strong-man act?" Ed said. "Not
a sideshow talker, nothing like that;
this guy had an act of his own, full
tent and flies. Gondo, his name was,
and I can still see those flies: <i>Eighth
Wonder of the World</i> up on top, red
on blue, and just <i>Gondo</i> underneath,
pure white with red outlining. Class,
but flashy, if you see what I mean.
You never saw the like, kid."</p>

<p>Charley shook his head. "O.K.,"
he said. "But what does this have to
do with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," Ed cut in, "that was years
ago; I was a youngster, pretty well
just setting out. And Gondo drew
crowds&mdash;big crowds. Lifting a wagonload
of people on his back&mdash;that
was one of his tricks. I think Sandow
himself used to do it, but he had
nothing on Gondo; the guy had style.
Class. And he was a draw; I was
working for J. C. Hobart Shows then,
and there was nothing on the lot to
top him."</p>

<p>Ed paused, rubbing at his chin reflectively.</p>

<p>"Then the crowds started to fall
off," he said. "Just like with you,
Charley. And nobody knew why.
Gondo was doing the same act&mdash;no
change there. So the change had to
be some place else."</p>

<p>"Same with me," Charley said.</p>

<p>"Sure," Ed said. "The same with
you. Charley, do you follow the
papers?"</p>

<p>"I guess so," Charley said. "One,
anyway. My mother sends it to me
from Chicago. She likes the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure," Ed said. "Well, did you
ever hear about a Dr. Schinsake?
Edmund Charles Schinsake?"</p>

<p>Charley snorted in surprise. "Who
do you think you are?" he said.
"Santa Claus?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Charley said. "It's
just ... well, nothing. But sure, I
know the guy. And so do you." He
explained.</p>

<p>"Professor Lightning?" Ed said.
"I never saw a picture. But it doesn't
matter&mdash;except maybe it'll make the
guy easier to see. Because this is it,
Charley; I think you ought to go and
see him."</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>"You, too?" Charley said. "You
mean, so I can stop being a poor,
poor cripple and stop making lots of
money? Is that what you're talking
about?"</p>

<p>"Listen, Charley," Ed said. "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just give up," Charley cut in.
"That's what you want me to do. Just
give up and go to the good old doctor
and ask him to give me some arms.
Is that what you wanted to tell me
about this Gondo of yours? How he
just gave up and got a nice little
white cottage some place and got a
nice little low-paying job and lived
unhappily ever after, because a carny
isn't a healthy, well-adjusted life? Is
that it, Ed?"</p>

<p>Ed Ribbed at his chin. "No, Charley,"
he said. "No, kid. Not at all.
But I think you ought to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I won't," Charley said.
"Look, Ed: I want you to get this
straight. I don't care who's against
me, or what they've got planned. I'm
not going to give up. I'm going to
find out what's going on, and I'm
going to lick it. Have you got it?"</p>

<p>Ed sighed. "I've got it," he said.
"But, Charley: there are some things
you don't lick."</p>

<p>"I'll find out," Charley said. "Believe
me, Ed. I'll find out."</p>

<hr />

<p>But nobody else knew a thing&mdash;or,
at least, nobody was willing to
talk. Ned and Ed offered any help
they could give&mdash;but said nothing
that helped. Erma was puzzled, but
ignorant; Senor Alcala knew nothing,
and no one else was any better off,
as far as Charley could discover.</p>

<p>After a week, Charley decided
there was only one person for him to
see. Ed Baylis had recommended him,
and so had the little Santa Claus.
Professor Lightning didn't look like
much of a lead, but there was nothing
else left. The audience was still
dropping, little by little, and Charley
knew perfectly well that something
had to be done, and fast.</p>

<p>Getting a leave of absence was
even easier than he'd expected it to
be; and that was just one more proof
of how far his standing with the
show had dropped. People just didn't
care; he wasn't a draw any more.</p>

<p>And his standing with the carny
was all he had left. He had caught
himself, lately, wondering if he
would really be so badly off with two
arms, like everybody else. The idea
frightened him, but the way it kept
coming back frightened him even
more.</p>

<p>Leaving the carny lot, of course,
he put on his sandals; outside the
carnival, he had to wear shoes. They
were laceless, of course, and made to
be kicked off easily. Charley slipped
into them and thought wryly of the
professor and his "scientific Renaissance."
The shoes were a new plastic,
lightweight and long-lasting, but the
dyeing problem hadn't quite been
solved. Instead of a quiet, dull brown,
they were a garish shade that almost
approached olive drab.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/004.png" width="600" height="438" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Well, he thought, nothing's perfect.
He shrugged into a harness and
had his single suitcase attached to it;
the harness and case were lightweight,
too, and Charley headed for
the station walking easily.</p>

<p>He climbed aboard the train and
dropped his suitcase into the Automatic
Porter, and then went to find a
seat. The only one available was next
to a middle-aged man chewing a
cigar in a sour silence. Charley slipped
into his seat without a word, and
hoped the man would ignore him. He
had a face like an overripe summer
squash, and his big hands, clasped in
his lap, were fat and white, covered
with tiny freckles. Charley leaned
back and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>A minute or so passed in silence.</p>

<p>Then a voice said: "Heading for
New York?"</p>

<p>"That's right," Charley said tiredly.
He opened his eyes. The middle-aged
man was leaning toward him,
smelling of his cheap cigar.</p>

<p>"Likewise," the man said. His
voice was hoarse and unpleasant. "I
thought you might be."</p>

<p>"That's right," Charley said.
"Long trip." He hoped desperately
that the man would leave him alone.
He wasn't on display now; he wanted
the time to think, to try and figure
out what had been happening. He
had to have some questions to ask
Professor Lightning, and that meant
that he had to have some sort of plan
of action.</p>

<p>"Going to see that doctor," the
middle-aged man said. "That right?"</p>

<p>"That's right," Charley said. Apparently
Professor Lightning had become
a nine-day wonder; anyone
going to New York was presumed
to be going to see him.</p>

<p>Then Charley corrected himself.
Not anyone.</p>

<p>Any cripple.</p>

<p>"Get the arms fixed, right?" the
middle-aged man said.</p>

<p>"That's right," Charley said for
the third time. Maybe the man would
take the hint.</p>

<p>But he had no such luck. "That's
a fine thing the doctor is doing," he
said. "I mean, helping all these people.
Don't have to be ... well, look,
bud, don't take me personally."</p>

<p>"I don't mind," Charley said. "I'm
used to it."</p>

<p>"Sure," the man said. "Hey, by the
way. My name's Roquefort. Al
Roquefort."</p>

<p>"Charley de Milo," Charley said.</p>

<p>"Glad to know you," the man
said. "So while we're traveling companions,
you might say ... might as
well get to be friendly."</p>

<p>"Sure," Charley said tiredly. He
looked round the car. A great many
people seemed to be heading East.
There were no other seats. Charley
sighed and shrugged himself deeper
into the upholstery.</p>

<p>"You know," Roquefort said suddenly,
"I can't help thinking."</p>

<p>"Oh?" Charley said, fidgeting his
feet.</p>

<p>"That's right," Roquefort said. "I
mean, all these people. And Dr.
Schinsake. I remember once, I went
to a circus, or a sideshow."</p>

<p>"Carnival, probably," Charley put
in, knowing exactly what was coming.</p>

<p>"Something like that," Roquefort
said. "Anyhow, they had this sideshow,
and there was a man there
without any legs. Did all kinds of
tricks&mdash;got along real good. But I
can't help thinking now: he wouldn't
have to get along that way any more.
Because this doctor would fix him
up."</p>

<p>"I guess so," Charley said wearily.</p>

<p>"Sure," Roquefort said. "It's a
great thing, what he's doing. All
these freak shows ... you understand,
it's just a name for them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand," Charley said.
"Don't worry about it." He shifted
his feet nervously. Shoes always felt
a little uncomfortable, even lightweight
sandals; he felt trapped in
them. Now, if he had arms and
hands ...</p>

<p>He choked the thought off before
it got any further.</p>

<p>"All these shows," Roquefort said,
"why, there isn't any need for them
any more. I mean the people without
legs, or arms, anyhow. See? Because
this doctor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see," Charley said.</p>

<p>"Why, anybody works in a show
like that, I mean without arms or legs&mdash;why,
he's just crazy, that's all.
When he can get help, I mean."</p>

<p>"Sure," Charley said uneasily.
"Sure, he's just crazy."</p>

<p>Roquefort chomped on his cigar
and looked solemn and well-informed.
Charley shivered slightly, and
wondered why.</p>

<p>"Just crazy." Was that what they
thought, he wondered. Was that what
they were thinking when they looked
up at him?</p>

<p>He shivered again and slipped his
shoes off quietly. Immediately, he felt
a little better.</p>

<p>But not very much.</p>

<hr />

<p>New York was a madhouse worse
than any carnival Charley had ever
seen. He made his way, harness and
suitcase on his back, through the station
crowds and out into the taxi
ramp. A line of the new cabs stood
there, and Charley managed to grab
one inches ahead of a woman with a
small, crying child in tow. He gestured
to the driver with his head, and
the door slid open. He stepped inside,
released the catch that let his suitcase
thump to the floor, and sat down with
a sigh.</p>

<p>"Tough, hey?" the cabbie said. His
glowing nameplate read <i>David Peters
Wells</i>. He turned around, showing
a face that had little in common
with the official license photo, under
his name. He was swarthy and short,
with large yellowing teeth and tiny
eyes. "Where to, Mac?" he said.</p>

<p>Charley licked his lips. "I really
don't know," he said.</p>

<p>The cabbie blinked. "What?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to need some help,"
Charley said. "I want to find a Dr.
Schinsake, but I don't know where he
is. If you can drive me to a drugstore,
where we can look him up in a phone
book&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dr. Schinsake?" the driver said.
"That's the guy who grows things?
I mean, arms and legs? Like that?"</p>

<p>"That's right," Charley said.</p>

<p>"O.K., buddy," the driver said.
"Just hang on." The cab started with
a cough and a roar, and shot out of
the terminal like a bazooka shell.
Over the noise of travel, the cabbie
said: "Going to get yourself fixed
up? No offense, Mac."</p>

<p>"No offense," Charley said. "I'm
just going to talk to him."</p>

<p>"Oh," the cabbie said. "Sure."
There was silence for a second. Then
the cabbie turned around. The machine
shot ahead, down a wide avenue
filled with cars. Charley took a deep
breath and forgot to let it go. "You
know," the cabbie said, "I seen something
funny the other day."</p>

<p>"Really?" Charley said, through
clenched teeth.</p>

<p>The cabbie turned back casually,
flicked the wheel to avoid an oncoming
truck, and continued: "Funny,
yeah. Went to the Flea Museum ...
you know, the sideshow here, on
Forty-second?"</p>

<p>"I know it," Charley said. He'd
been offered winter work in the place
several times, though he'd never accepted.
Everyone in carny life knew
of the place.</p>

<p>"And, anyhow, I went down the
other day, and there was this guy ...
he was like you, Mac, I mean no
arms. You don't mind me talking
about it?"</p>

<p>Apparently everybody thought he
was sensitive on the subject, Charley
reflected tiredly. "I don't mind," he
said.</p>

<p>"Sure," the cabbie said. A red
light showed ahead and the cab
screeched to a halt. "Anyhow, there
he was, like a freak, you know? Hell,
Mac, I was mad. I mean mad. The
guy wants me to pay money to see
him; he don't want to go get cured.
He's like lazy, Mac. Lazy. Wants to
sit around and let me pay money I
work hard for, like some kind of a
stuffed exhibit he thinks he is." The
light changed; the cab shuddered and
moved on. "And this doctor right
here in the same city. Now, what do
you think of that?"</p>

<p>Charley shrugged. "I wouldn't
know," he said cautiously. He took
out a cigarette with his left foot, lit it
with his right, and slid both feet back
into his shoes. "Nearly there?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No offense, Mac," the cabbie
said, sounding obscurely troubled.
"We're there in a minute." He turned
and stared narrowly at Charley.
The cab shot blindly on. "Say, listen.
That with the cigarette. You belong
to some kind of sideshow? I mean,
no offense&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No offense," Charley said.
"That's right. I'm with a carnival."</p>

<p>"We'll, you're doing the right
thing," the cabbie said, turning back
to the road again. Amazingly, there
was no obstruction before them. "I
mean, a guy has to be honest. With
this doctor around, you can't be a no-arms
guy any more; it's not fair.
Right?"</p>

<p>Charley licked his lips. The cab
stopped.</p>

<p>"Here we are," the driver announced.</p>

<p>Charley indicated his grouch-bag,
still heavy with dollar bills, hanging
round his neck. With scrupulous care,
the driver extracted one bill. "Keep
the change," Charley said. "And
thanks for the conversation."</p>

<p>He stepped out, hooking the suitcase
to his harness as he did so. And
there, in front of him, was a small
white-faced stone building. The cab
roared away behind him, and Charley
started across the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Now, in New York, he had found
out what he was going to ask Professor
Lightning. And it was the one
thing he hadn't thought possible.</p>

<hr />

<p>One flight of stairs led straight up
from the doorway, and Charley took
it slowly. At the top was a great
wooden door with a brass plate screwed
to it, and on the brass plate a single
name was incised: <i>Dr. E. C.
Schinsake</i>. There was nothing else.
Charley slipped the shoe off his right
foot, and rang the bell.</p>

<p>A voice inside said: "Who's there?
Who is it, please?"</p>

<p>"It's me, professor," Charley called.
He slipped the sandal back on.
"Charley de Milo. I came to see you."</p>

<p>"Charley&mdash;" There was a second
of silence. "Charley de Milo?" Professor
Lightning's grating voice said.
"From the show?" Footsteps came
across a room, and the door swung
open. Professor Lightning stood inside,
just as tall and white-haired as
ever, and Charley blinked, looking at
him, and past him at the room.</p>

<p>People didn't live in rooms like
that, he thought. They were only for
the movies, or maybe for millionaires,
but not for people, real people that
Charley himself knew to talk to.</p>

<p>The furniture&mdash;a couch, a few
chairs and tables, a phonograph&mdash;was
glitteringly new and expensive-looking.
The walls were freshly painted
in soft, bright colors, and pictures
hung on them, strange-looking pictures
Charley couldn't make sense out
of. But they looked right, somehow,
in that room.</p>

<p>On the floor there was a rug deeper
and softer-looking than any Charley
had ever seen. And, away to the
right, two floor-length windows sparkled,
hung with great drapes and
shining in the daylight. There were
flowers growing outside the sills, just
visible above the window frames.
Charley gulped and took a breath.</p>

<p>"Come in," Professor Lightning
said. "Come in." In the midst of the
riot of wealth, the professor didn't
seem to have changed at all. He was
still wearing the same ratty robe he'd
worn in the carnival, his hair was still
as uncombed. It was only on second
glance that Charley saw the look in
his eyes. Professor Lightning was Dr.
Schinsake now; the eyes said that,
and were proud of it. And the world
agreed with Dr. Schinsake.</p>

<p>Charley came into the bright room
and stood quietly until Dr. Schinsake
asked him to sit down.</p>

<p>"Well, now, my boy," he said.
"You haven't given me a word since
you rang the bell, and I would like to
know why you're here. Frankly,
you're lucky to catch me in; but we
were up late last night, working in
the labs. I'm afraid I overslept a
little." His eyes shone with the mention
of his laboratories. It was a far
cry from the back of the science tent,
Charley supposed.</p>

<p>But he'd come for a definite purpose.
He licked his lips, waited a second,
and said: "Professor, it's about
my arms. What you said you could
do."</p>

<p>"Your arms?" The old man frowned.
"Now? You've come to me ...
Charley, my boy, tell me why. Tell
me why you have changed your mind
now."</p>

<p>Charley nodded. "I ... I didn't
start out here to ask you about my
arms," he said. "But on the way I
started putting things together. Professor,
why do people come to side-shows?"</p>

<p>The old man shrugged. "Entertainment,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Sure, but there are all kinds of
entertainment," Charley said. "Like
strong men. There used to be a lot of
strong men in carnivals, but there
aren't any more. And now I know
why. Ed Baylis started to tell me, but
I ... well, never mind."</p>

<p>"Charley," the old man said.
"What do strong men have to do
with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me tell you, professor," Charley
said. "People don't care about
strong men any more; there are too
many gadgets around. Nobody has to
be a strong man; nobody wants to
watch one. They're useless. See?"</p>

<p>"Everyone can be his own strong
man," the old man said.</p>

<p>"Right," Charley said. "The chain
hoist&mdash;machines like that&mdash;they killed
off the whole act. Years ago. And
you've killed off the Armless Wonders
and the Legless Wonders, professor.
You've done it, all at once."</p>

<p>Professor Lightning shook his
head. "I don't see&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Anybody can grow new arms,"
Charley said. "So the man without
arms&mdash;he's not an object of pity any
more. He's just some guy who doesn't
want to work. Nobody wants to go
and see him; let him grow arms, if
he doesn't want to be called a lazy
bum. See?"</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>"I see," Professor Lightning said
slowly. "Without pity, without a
strong sense of identification, there is
no audience."</p>

<p>"For me there isn't," Charley
said. "Or for anybody like me."</p>

<p>Professor Lightning nodded.
"Well," he said. "I hardly meant to
... well, Charley, you came for
something else." His face seemed to
lengthen. "And I must tell you ...
Charley, I have been doing a lot of
work. I am hardly a professional scientist;
I have been away too long."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is true," Professor Lightning
said sadly. "Never mind; I've had
my one discovery&mdash;how much an accident,
no one may ever know. But I
neglected to widen the scope of what
I had done; I generalized too rapidly,
my boy." He took a deep breath.
"The method, the technique, is very
complex," he said. "But imagine it
this way: a man comes to New York.
He explores it. Later, when he goes
home, he is asked to draw a map of
it&mdash;and he can do so, because he has
the experience. He has the memory
of New York, locked in his
mind."</p>

<p>Charley nodded. "What does that
have to do with me?" he said.</p>

<p>"The cells ... the cells of the
body seem to have such a memory,"
the professor said. "It is the basis of
my technique."</p>

<p>Charley nodded. "O.K.," he said
"I don't care how it works, so long
as it&mdash; It does work, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>The professor shook his head. Very
slowly, he said: "Not for you, my
boy. Not for you." He paused. "You
see, you were born without arms. In
such a case the cellular memory does
not seem to exist&mdash;like a man who
has never been to New York. He
cannot draw the map. He has no
memory to begin with."</p>

<p>The silence this time was a long
one.</p>

<p>At last Charley said: "But somebody
could tell him. I mean about
New York, so he could draw the
map."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," the professor said. "We
are working on it. Some day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But not today," Charley said. "Is
that it?"</p>

<p>"I ... I'm afraid so," the professor
said.</p>

<p>Charley sat for a long time, thinking.
He pictured the carnival, and the
shrinking audiences. Could he explain
to them why he couldn't get
arms? Would any audience stop to
listen and digest the truth? Charley
thought of the armless man in the
Flea Museum, and decided slowly
that no explanation would be good
enough. People didn't stop to make
small distinctions. Not in a sideshow.
Not in a carnival.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>There was only one thing he could
do; he saw that clearly. But it took
him a long time to find the right
words. At last he had them.</p>

<p>"Professor," he said, "suppose I go
right back to being a sideshow exhibit&mdash;but
with a limited audience."</p>

<p>Professor Lightning looked puzzled.
"What do you mean?" he said.</p>

<p>"Well," Charley said, carefully
and with a sudden, surprising feeling
of hope, "you don't happen to need a
new guinea pig, do you?"</p>
